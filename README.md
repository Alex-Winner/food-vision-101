# Food Vision 101 üçîüëÅ
**Food-101:** A Delicious Deep Learning Journey

![Food Vision 101 Logo](/docs/images/food-101.png)

Food Vision 101 is a machine learning project that aims to classify and recognize different types of food items using deep learning techniques. This project provides a pre-trained model that can identify various dishes and ingredients from images.

A goal of this project: 
* beat the **[Food101 PAPER](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/)** with only 10% of the data, a 2014 paper with average accuracy of 50.76%. 
* beat the **[DeepFood PAPER](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment)** with 100% of the data, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.

> üîë **Note:** 
> * **Top-1 accuracy** means "accuracy for the top softmax activation value output by the model" (because softmax ouputs a value for every class, but top-1 means only the highest one is evaluated). 
> * **Top-5 accuracy** means "accuracy for the top 5 softmax activation values output by the model", in other words, did the true label appear in the top 5 activation values? Top-5 accuracy scores are usually noticeably higher than top-1.
